# Sorting Algorithms Tester
	
<p>This program compares the running time of 4 different sorting algorithms at input sizes n ranging, by default,
from 1000 to 20000. The user can change all the parameters of the program, including the input size range, the increment
between input sizes, and the number of simulations to be ran at each input size. The numbers to be sorted are generated 
using the rand() function and stored in a two dimensional vector of ints.</p>
	
<p>To use the program, download, compile, and run. Enter your desired parameters, or just press enter for the default
values. Select which algorithm you would like to test, and the program will tell you the average running time of the
algorithm at each input size.</p>

WARNING: Selection sort and insertion sort will take a fairly long time at large input sizes on most systems.
